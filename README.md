# Apple Cloning Project

This project aims to clone the Apple website to practice and demonstrate front-end development skills. The project includes a responsive design, navigation, and several interactive elements, mimicking the look and feel of the official Apple website. BootStrap CSS Framework and SaSS is used for styling, and web components are used for creating reusable UI elements. Dynamic data is loaded to enhance interactivity.

## Project Overview
The Apple Cloning Project is a front-end development exercise focused on replicating the design and functionality of the Apple website. This project leverages BootStrap CSS Framework and SaSS for styling, web components for modular UI elements, and dynamic data for enhanced interactivity. It is intended for educational purposes, helping developers practice modern web development techniques.

## Features
- Responsive design using BootStrap CSS Framework and SaSS
- Navigation bar with dropdown menus
- Interactive product display
- Modular and reusable web components
- Dynamic data loading

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- BootStrap CSS Framework and SaSS
- JavaScript
- Web Components
- [Additional library : https://swiperjs.com/]

## Project Setup
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
    - Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the remote repository you cloned from GitLab:
      ```bash
      git clone https://git.clp.kr/anbschool/2nd/tech-a/prak-sreypov/praksreypov-apple-clone.git
      ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Navigate to the cloned project directory:
      ```bash
      cd 2nd-mission
      ```
3. **View the Website**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in your text editor or code editor.
    - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with" or "Open in Browser" (depending on your operating system).

## Usage
- Navigate through the website using the navigation bar.
- Explore different sections to see the replicated design and functionality.
- Interact with product displays and dropdown menus to see animations and transitions.
- Observe how dynamic data is loaded and displayed using web components.
